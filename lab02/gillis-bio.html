        <h2>Personal info</h2>
        Hello, my name is Hannah Gillis. I am a dual student in the <strong>iSchool</strong> and <strong>Whitman</strong>, studying Information Management & Technology, and Finance. 
        I chose these majors because I am interested in seeing how business and technology overlap. 
        I am a Leadership Scholar which is one of my accomplishments, and skill wise I have become proficient in Excel, as I used it a lot at my summer internship. 
       
       <p> Some of my favorite hobbies include going paddleboarding, relaxing at the beach, reading, and going skiing. 
        My favorite show right now is Suits and some of my favorite music artists are Chris Lake and Calvin Harris. 
        I have a younger sister named Sarah, and a dog named Moose.
