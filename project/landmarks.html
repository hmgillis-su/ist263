                        Located at 330 First Parish Road, Lawson tower is a unique sight in Scituate MA. It is the most expensive water tower in the world! Built in 1902 Thomas Lawson built the tower to hide the ugly steel water tank inside it. Thomas also added bells to the tower as well, which can be heard ringing on occasion in Scituate. The tower was bought by the town in 1923 and since then the Scituate Historical Society has preserved the tower, and all towers up the tower sometimes as well.

                        As the most Irish town in America, Scituate's first Irish immigrants created a hub for the mossing industry. Now there is a museum showcasing the history of mossing in Scituate, which has been featured in Smithsonian Magazine, Chronicle, the History Channel and more. It's a great spot to learn more about Scituate's unique history.

                        The Scituate lighthouse is one of the town's most iconic landmarks. Built in 1810 the US Congress gave money to build this lighthouse, which was then built by only three men. It is most famous for its involvement and usage during the War of 1812. There is a long jetty attached to the lighthouse which is a great place to walk and view the waves entering the harbor.
