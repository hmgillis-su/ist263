                Jenna Malley said 5/5 starts for Salt Society 3 months ago:
                “Really great sushi right in downtown Scituate! We sat outside and it was such a lovely day. The servers were quick and attentive and super nice. Really recommend visiting this place for a relaxing lunch or dinner! Bonus: they're dog friendly outside!”
