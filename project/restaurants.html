                “Really great sushi right in downtown Scituate! We sat outside and it was such a lovely day. The servers were quick and attentive and super nice. Really recommend visiting this place for a relaxing lunch or dinner! Bonus: they're dog friendly outside!”

                Gabe Link said : 
                “Such a good spot to sit and chill and/or work. Lucky Finn came as a recommendation from a friend, and it was a great place for the much needed break in my day. I had a mocha and the avocado and tomato bagel which I highly recommend. Stop by if you're in the area.”
