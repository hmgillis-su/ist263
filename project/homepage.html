                <h3>1. Minot Beach</h3>
                <p>
                    The fan favorite beach in Scituate because of its clear water, and gorgeous views! The low tide here is the best because it makes the beach a lot bigger to play games on and splash around on the sand bar. Kids love this beach because there is a huge rock, called Well Rock, you can climb and play on! 
                </p>

                <h3>2. Peggotty Beach</h3>
                <p>
                    Best known for its soft sand and pretty sunsets. One of the smaller beaches, but it has the best sand and gorgeous views on the cliffs. This beach is a fan favorite with dogs!

                <h3>3. Egypt Beach</h3>
                <p>
                    A very unique beach made up of thousands of flat rocks, with little sand. This beach is great for nighttime bonfires and its bigger waves. One of the best places to surf in Scituate. The only issue with this beach is that the hill of rocks makes it difficult to find a level place to sit or rest.

            <div>
                <h3>4. Humarock Beach</h3>
                <p>
                    Humarock is a peninsula that is separate from the main town of Scituate, but still owned by Scituate, making this beach a slightly longer drive. The biggest beach in Scituate, with a mix of sand and rocks. Humarock is the best place to watch fireworks on the fourth of July! The main beach entrance has a couple restaurants and an ice cream store right nearby!
